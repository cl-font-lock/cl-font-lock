* Description
Add pretty colors to common-lisp, from [[https://github.com/sheepduke/emacs-settings/blob/master/settings/d2-dev-lisp.el][emacs-settings]].

* Install
Install from [[https://melpa.org][Melpa]]!

* Known Issues
- There is no context, so sometimes certain symbols will be highlighted unexpectedly. Consider =(return nil)= vs. =#\return=.

* Other Notes
The following code is an sample of how the symbols were extracted.

Some manual work was taken to tune the result.

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
(defvar *functions* nil)
(defvar *symbols* nil)
(defvar *types* nil)

(let ((pack (find-package :common-lisp)))
  (do-all-symbols (sym)
    (cond
      ((not (eql pack (symbol-package sym))) nil)
      ((fboundp sym) (pushnew sym *functions*))
      ((find-class sym nil) (pushnew sym *types*))
      (t (pushnew sym *symbols*)))))
#+END_SRC
